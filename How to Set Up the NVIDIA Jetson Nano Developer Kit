Setup and First Boot:
  1. Make sure the jumper is pushed into the J48 Power Select Header pins.
  2. Power Supply Applicable for Jetson Nano 5V/4A OD 5.5mm ID 2.1mm.
  
Run Updates:
  1. Open the terminal, and type
      sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
  2. Reboot the computer.
      sudo reboot
  
Collect Information About Your Jetson Nano:
  1. Open the terminal, and type
      hostname -I
  2. Change the Power Supply Settings
      sudo nvpmodel -q ---> NV Power Mode: MAXN
  3. Otherwise, type the following command
      sudo nvpmodel -m 0
  4. If you want to change it to low performance because you are using microUSB to power the Jetson Nano, here is the command
      sudo nvpmodel -m 1
  
Create a Swap File:
  1. See if your Nano already has swap space.
      free -h
  2. If you don’t have swap space, add a 4GB swap file.
      sudo fallocate -l 4G /var/swapfile
      sudo chmod 600 /var/swapfile
      sudo mkswap /var/swapfile
      sudo swapon /var/swapfile
      sudo bash -c 'echo "/var/swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab'
  3. Reboot your Nano.
      sudo reboot

Set Up the VNC Server:
  1. Connecting the Board to Your Wireless Network.
  2. Enabling Desktop Sharing.
  First, open the terminal and paste this line.
      sudo nano /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/org.gnome.Vino.gschema.xml
  Next, add (paste) the following key into the XML file which just opened in nano editor.
      <key name=’enabled’ type=’b’>
      <summary>Enable remote access to the desktop</summary>
      <description>
      If true, allows remote access to the desktop via the RFB
      protocol. Users on remote machines may then connect to the
      desktop using a VNC viewer.
      </description>
      <default>true</default>
      </key>
  Now, after pasting, save and exit. Next, Compile the schemas for Gnome using the command below
      sudo glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas
  Tick the “Allow other users to view your desktop” and also “Allow other users to control your desktop” checkmarks. 
  Then make sure “You must confirm each access to this machine” is turned off. 
  Finally tick the “Require the user to enter this password” checkmark, and enter a password for the VNC session.
  3. Start the VNC server on every startup.
  Open ‘startup applications’ using the search box that appears at the top of the screen.
  Now, click Add at the right of the box, then type ‘Vino’ in the name box, and then in the command box enter /usr/lib/vino/vino-server.
  Click Save at the bottom right of the box, and then close the app.
  Next, we need to disable encryption of the VNC connection to get things working. To do this, open the terminal and enter the following commands
      gsettings set org.gnome.Vino require-encryption false
      gsettings set org.gnome.Vino prompt-enabled false
